This is a personal blog about topics that interest me. I usually cover topics that I'm learning or something that I have learnt in the past. The purpose of writing this is to mainly help me find gaps in my knowledge while also sharing knowledge with others who are interested in such topics.

The topics I cover ranges over from Mathematics, Physics, Programming, Electronics and to Embedded systems. I may even cover other topics that I find interesting.

If you find that there is an error in something that I write or if you think that something can be explained better, please don't hesitate to let me know. I want to improve the content that I create so that it can be useful to others and it will also help improve my understanding things too. So your valueable feedback is welcomed.

The best way to contact me is by email. You can find my email bellow along with some other links.
