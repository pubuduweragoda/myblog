      <description>This is a personal blog about topics that interest me. I usually cover topics that I&amp;rsquo;m learning or something that I have learnt in the past. The purpose of writing this is to mainly help me find gaps in my knowledge while also sharing knowledge with others who are interested in such topics.
The topics I cover ranges over from Mathematics, Physics, Programming, Electronics and to Embedded systems. I may even cover other topics that I find interesting.</description>
